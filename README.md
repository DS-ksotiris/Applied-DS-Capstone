Introduction
SpaceX has transformed the space industry through innovation, offering Falcon 9 launches at just $62 million compared to competitors' prices exceeding $165 million. This dramatic cost reduction comes primarily from SpaceX's pioneering approach of recovering and reusing the first stage rocket by landing it safely after launch, with potential for even lower costs as reuse frequency increases.

As a data scientist at a competing space startup, your task is to develop a machine learning system that can forecast whether a first stage will successfully land. This predictive model is vital for determining competitive pricing when bidding against SpaceX for launch contracts, as understanding landing success factors directly impacts cost structures and pricing strategy.
